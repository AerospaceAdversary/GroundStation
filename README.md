# GroundStation

Included in this repository are all files and software pertaining to the Open-Source Ground Station project sponsored by Space@Hopkins. The project is divided into three submodules: Hardware, Automation, and IDS. The Hardware module contains STL files for 3D printing the necessary components and wiring schematics for assembling the station. The Automation module contains the programs necessary for autonomous satellite tracking and data downlink. The IDS module contains the programs necessary for running the intrusion detection system, which monitors traffic and detects malicious connections to the station.

Instructions for running each module can be found in the respective directories.
